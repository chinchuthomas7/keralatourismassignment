            announcing plans to set ua Malabar Literary Circuit, which is billed as
            the first literary tourism circuit in the country, in the budget. Literary
            tourism allows travelers with a literary bent of mind to trail their favourite
            authors and locales associated with their
            literary works. Countries like
            the United Kingdom have capitalized on literary tourism in a big way by
            showcasing a string of locales associated with literary giants like
            Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford upon Avon and Thomas Hardy's
            Dorset, among many others.

   <h3> ABOUT KERALA</h3>
 <P id="about">
   Kerala is a state on the Malabar Coast of India.It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the
   States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar,
   South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state
   by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the
   Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,406,061 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest
   Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is
   the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.

   The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala
   kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a
   prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as
   the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved
   the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century,
   there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi
   in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British
   India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956,
   the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk
   of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod
   (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara (Tulunad), and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern
   taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).

   The economy of Kerala is the 10th-largest in India with ₹7.82 trillion (US$110 billion) in gross state domestic
   product (GSDP) and a per capita GSDP of ₹204,000 (US$2,900).Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in
   India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate,
   96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy,
   77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. Kerala is the second-least </p>

   major state in the country with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India.The state topped in the
   country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in
   2019.The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the
   Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali
   expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity.
   The culture is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over millennia, under
   influences from other parts of India and abroad.

   The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. In the
   agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state is situated between Arabian
   Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain ranges to the east. The state's coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370
   mi), and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the
   state's income. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages,
   mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with coconut-lined sandy
   beaches, backwaters, hill stations, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions.</i>
