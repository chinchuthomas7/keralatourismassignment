                A hilly province of pristine splendour, Pathanamthitta district is hailed as the centre of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers cross through its terrain comprising lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty percent of the total area of this region is covered by forests. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique Aranmula Kannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted - and the Vasthu Vidya Gurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.Situated near the Western Ghats and bordered by the hills, Pathanamthitta district is a treat to eyes with its vast unending stretches of forests, rivers and rural landscapes. Blessed by nature, the district is famous for its scenic beauty, fairs and festivals.
